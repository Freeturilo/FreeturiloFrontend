/**
 * A service for API data transaction.
 * <p>
 * Object of a class implementing this interface connects to an API and handles
 * external data transactions of the application. Every method within this
 * interface should be implemented as asynchronous and return the thread which
 * handles the method's logic. An {@code APIHandler} can be provided (to handle
 * potential transaction errors) in every method. A {@code Callback} can be
 * provided (to handle received payload) in all methods that are expected to
 * receive a payload. It is recommended to use {@code APIRunnable} for the
 * method's implementation as it makes it easy to use {@code APIHandler} and
 * {@code Callback} classes.
