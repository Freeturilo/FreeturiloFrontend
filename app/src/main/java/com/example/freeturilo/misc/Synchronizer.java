/**
 * An executor of a callback after asynchronous methods finish.
 * <p>
 * An object of this class executes a synchronous {@link #callback} when a set
 * of synchronous or asynchronous methods decrement its {@link #counter} to
 * zero. It is usually used when multiple asynchronous methods are ran at once
 * and all their results are then used for a synchronous method. An example of
 * this scenario is simultaneously downloading a map and locations to be placed
 * on the map. After the download the locations get synchronously placed on the
 * map.
